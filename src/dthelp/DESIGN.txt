Proposed on-line documentation design
Version: 1.0
Authors: Robert Tomsick <robert@tomsick.net>

Description
-----------
This document describes the design of the OpenCDE online help system.

It defines the following:
    - Filesystem conventions/layout
    - Documentation authoring guidelines
        - tone and style
        - markup template(s)/conventions
    - dthelp functionality

Within this document, the terms "MUST", "MAY", "SHOULD", "MAY NOT", and
"MUST NOT" are defined as in RFC <TODO>.

File Structure
--------------
Documentation is to be organized according to the application to which
the documentation corresponds, and grouped according to the 
tasks/features of the application.

Documentation will be kept in a single directory tree (location TBD)
with the following structure:

|- doc
    |- en
        |- html
            |- root.html
            |- global
                |- terminology
                    |- <term>.html
            |- <application>
                |- terminology
                    |- <term>.html
                |- <task section>
                    |- <task>.html
        |- images
            |- global
            |- <application>
                (optional -- for app. sections w/ many images:)
                |- <task section>
                    |- <feature>
                    
<application> is to be replaced with the name of the application in
question Examples: "dtpanel", "dtfile", etc.

<task section> is to be replaced with a string consisting of a single
token describing a set of tasks; this is to allow the documentation to
be divided according to the functionality of the application being 
documented.  Examples: "printing", "filehandling", "menu_editing"

<task> is to be replaced with the name of the feature or task documented 
by a single HTML document.  Examples: "print_preview", as part of 
"print_preview.html" would correspond to the "Print Preview" feature of
an application.

An example file structure for the dtpanel application might look as 
follows:

    |- doc
        |- html
            |- [...]
            |- dtpanel
				|- terminology
					|- locking.html
                |- menu
                    |- editing.html
                    |- icons.html
                |- workspaces
                    |- using.html
        |- images
            |- global
            |- dtpanel
                |- menu
                    |- custom_menu_screenshot.xpm
                    |- icon_template.xpm
                    
In the above example, one might expect information to be presented as 
such:

    dtpanel -> menu -> editing
        Describes how to edit the category titles, add applications to
        drawers, use the drawers/menus to launch applications, etc.
    dtpanel -> menu -> icons
        Describes the acceptable file formats for menu icons, icon color
        standards, icon sizing guidelines, creation tips, etc.
    dtpanel -> workspaces -> using
        Describes how to use the "workspace" or "virtual desktop" 
        feature of the application.


Documentation Guidelines - Writing Style
------------------------
Documentation MUST:
    - Use proper punctuation, capitalization, grammar, and spelling.
    - Link all terminology to the appropriate terminology document
      (either global or application-specific) and use the same terms as
      are defined in said document.
    - Use consistent terminology and consistent descriptions:
        - Example - CORRECT:
            "The 'Print Preview' feature may be used to preview a 
             document prior to printing" [...] "To view a preview of the
             document, select the 'Print Preview' feature from the 
             'File' menu."
        - Example - INCORRECT:
            "The 'Page Preview' feature may be used to preview a 
             page prior to printing" [...] "To view a preview of the
             document, select the 'Print Preview' feature from the 
             'File' menu."

Documentation SHOULD:
    - Be as simple and easy-to-understand as possible.
    - Provide examples of features the use of which is not immediately
      obvious to the user.
    - Require no more than a basic high-school/secondary-school 
      knowledge of the language in which it is written.
    - Avoid repetition.
    - Demonstrate a clear and full understanding of the functionality 
      being documented.

Documentation MAY:
	- Offer real-world analogies.
		- Example: Comparing the "desktop" metaphor of computing with 
		  the layout of a physical desk.
	- Offer comparisons to other features within OpenCDE (though such
      comparisons should probably be used sparingly if at all so as to 
      prevent "link hell".)
    - Assume knowledge of product functionality outlined elsewhere in
      the documentation.  It is strongly recommended, but not required,
      that references to such functionality be accompanied by links to 
      the corresponding parts of the product's documentation.  In cases
      where a link is not provided, the use of terminology should be 
      such that users may easily search the product documentation on 
      their own.
      
Documentation MUST NOT:
	- Use the passive voice:
        - Example - CORRECT:
            "To view a preview of the document, select 'Print Preview' 
            from the 'File' menu."
        - Example - INCORRECT:
            "A preview of the document may be viewed by selecting
            'Print Preview' from the 'File' menu."
    - Mention religion, politics, sexual preference, financial
      status, or other inflammatory or controversial topics.
    - Use humor.  While humor may make documentation seem more 
      enjoyable to read, it does not always come across well and poses
      problems for internationalization.
    - Use "you", "I", or "we".
    - Use trademarks or brand names without proper citation.
    - Use copyrighted material without explicit (AND DOCUMENTED) 
      permission.
	- Make derogatory, critical, or antagonistic remarks towards any 
	  person, place, or product, even when such remarks are used 
	  colloquially.
			- Example - CORRECT:
				"[...] This feature should be compatible with all but a
				few Motif applications. [...]"
			- Example - INCORRECT:
				"[...] This feature should be compatible with all but 
				the most retarded Motif applications. [...]"
	- Use profanity (i.e. "swear" or "curse" words).
	- Use region-specific examples in a manner which would prevent the
	  substitution of a similar example during internationalization.
			- Example - ACCEPTABLE
				"Clicking the 'Send Mail' will send the message.  This 
				 action is similar to dropping a letter in a post box --
				 once it's been sent it cannot be recalled."
				 
				 (This is acceptable, as most nations have a postal 
				 system, and thus the example is suitable for 
				 internationalization.)
	- Assume a knowledge of product functionality not outlined elsewhere
	  in the documentation.

Documentation Guidelines - Markup Conventions
---------------------------------------------

URLs

	- URLs used in links, etc. should be relative.
	- URLs to external resources are NOT allowed.  (There are two 
	  reasons for this: 1) for remote URLs, not all users will have an
	  active Internet connection, 2) for local URLs, not all users may
	  have the external software/documentation/resources available.)

Terminology

	Terminology should be accompanied by a link to the definition page
	for the term in question.  The text of the term should also appear 
	in italics (i.e. wrapped with the <i> tag).
	
	Example:
		
		dtpanel also offers <a href="../../terminology/locking.html">
		<i>locking</i></a> functionality.

Bold, italics, underline
	
	Bold, italics, and underline tags should be used sparingly.  Their
	use may or may not carry semantic meaning depending on the context.
	In cases where they do not carry semantic meaning, their use may 
	prove confusing or distracting to users.
	
	Examples of reasonable use for bold/italics:
		
		Emptying the trash will <b>permanently</b> delete its contents.
		
		Screen locking is intended as a convenience, and is <u>not</u> a
		substitute for securing the data stored on a workstation.
	
Images
	
	The 'src' attribute of an image tag MUST be a relative URL.
	
	Only images included within the OpenCDE documentation tree may be 
	used.
	
	Image tags MUST contain an 'alt' attribute, the contents of which 
	MUST be a description of the contents of the image.
	
Header Structure
	
	Tasks
	
	Each document within the documentation tree which covers a single 
	task (see File Structure for examples) must contain a header 
	structure as follows:
	
		<html>
			<head>
				<title>$APPLICATION / $SECTION / $TASK</title>
			</head>
			
			<body>
				<p><a href="../..">$APPLICATION</a> / 
					<a href="..">$SECTION</a> /
					<b>$TASK</b>
				</p>
				
				<p>BODY CONTENT GOES HERE</p>
			</body>
		</html>

	
	Sections
	
	
	
	Terminology
