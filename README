OpenCDE
-------

*** Compiling / Installing ***

Before attempting to compile OpenCDE, you must edit the 'config.Mk'
file. Ensure that the PLATFORM variable is set to your target platform
and that the PREFIX variable points to the location in which you would
like to install OpenCDE to.

If using an operating system other than FreeBSD or Linux, you will
likely need to modify the CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS to point to your
build environment.

OpenCDE requires no dependencies other than OpenMotif and it's required
libraries.

You can compile and install OpenCDE by issuing the following commands

$ cd opencde
$ make
# make install

If you are porting OpenCDE and require the build to be handled by some
kind of build harness, you can use the following commands to prevent you
from needing to edit config.Mk.

$ cd opencde
$ make PLATFORM=FREEBSD
# make PREFIX=/usr/local install

Enjoy,

The OpenCDE Consortium
